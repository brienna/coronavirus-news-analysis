    "hey guise hey guise hi wow\n",

Take an example, “I ate so many grilled …” next word “sandwiches” will be predicted based on how many times “grilled sandwiches” have appeared together in the training data. As we are getting suggestions based only on the frequency, there are many scenarios where this approach could fail."
